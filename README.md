# Aristotelian-Gravity
This is a project focusing on recreating Aristotelian Physics regarding projectile motion. Aristotleâ€™s ideas were that objects that are launched, example a projectile from a cannon, will be pushed by reverse air resistance in a straight line. This will continue until the reverse air resistance can no longer push and the object falls straight down. This idea was continuously used by artillery manuals and armies till the 1600s when his ideas were proven false.
